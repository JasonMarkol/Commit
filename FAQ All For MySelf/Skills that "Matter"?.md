# Skills that "Matter"

Having an existential crisis about what life's purpose is.<br/>
I don't want to waste any time on things that we weren't here to do.<br/>
The last 5 years, I have cut out all abusable substances,(including things like all addictive bad habits like videogames, excluding things that are simple to manage like caffeine)
As of right now I have been focused on training these primary goals to expert levels, 5 years deep so far:<br/>
Biochemistry PHD<br/>
Black Belt in BJJ and Muay Thai<br/>
Stand Up Comedy<br/>
Archery<br/>
Reading Everyday<br/>
Learning the German Language<br/>
Guitar + Painting/Drawing + Poetry Everday<br/>
Building my Interpersonal Relationships (connecting)<br/>
Pick Up Artistry<br/>
My job is a Care Giver, And I am a Suicide Prevention Hotline volunteer on scheduled free time, <br/>
and my unscheduled free time goes to perfecting my skills through training.
However none of these things that I've obsessed on in the last 5 years I just don't feel like I'm spending my time wisely because it's not to "life's purpose". What are things that actually matter in life. (btw, I wanna be a biochemist to try and help people reach immortality, almost through my b.s, I feel like survival is the closest thing to spending your time wisely and immortality is the ultimate survival)


# Answer 

Try new things. All the things you've been doing for the past 5 years might just not be for you. Just keep trying new things until you find something that you like and is fulfilling. You won't know what it is until you try.
You can start by picking 1 thing you like doing now and do something similar to that to see if you like it any better or worse.
