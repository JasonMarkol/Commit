# The #1 technique I use to get more done > "time blocking"

How to “time block” (and why it’s the best productivity hack you should use)
<br/>
Over the last few years of constant experimentation and refinement to my own productivity system, there is one technique I’ve continued to use and recommend since day 1; “time blocking”.
<br/>

This technique is simple, effective and I feel is one of the key reasons why I get so much done.
<br/>
While time blocking may not be for everyone, if you haven’t tried it before, I highly recommend you give it a go for a week or two (it might just change how you work, forever).
<br/>
In this post, I’ll introduce you to time blocking and guide you, step-by-step, through how to apply this powerful technique.
<br/>
“Time blocking” is one of the best ways of turning good intentions into action.
<br/>


# What is “time blocking”

<br/>
Time blocking is the practice of scheduling appointments on your calendar 
<br/>
to illustrate when you’re going to work on a particular task or project.
<br/>
For example, let’s say I have a task on my to-do list like: 
<br/>
“Prepare sales presentation” I would then “block” out (or “schedule”) time on my calendar to work on this task. 
<br/>
Maybe I want to work on it from 10am – 12pm on Wednesday. That’s where this “block” would go on the calendar.


<br/>
Time blocking can be performed at the beginning of the day as you plan what you’re going to work on.
<br/>
Better yet, you could plan your time the day before as you finish up your workday. That way, you can start the new day and get straight into your first task.
<br/>
Or, better still, time blocking could be performed at the start of your week (or the even the end of the previous week) where you plan your entire week in advance.
<br/>
At this point, I’m sure lots of readers are thinking “What?! I can’t plan my entire week. Plans change, what about emergencies, this is too rigid for me!”.
<br/>
But don’t worry, I will address all of these concerns below.


# The advantages of time blocking

Firstly, let’s look at why time blocking is such a useful productivity technique (or if you want to skip ahead and get straight into the practical steps, click here):
<br/>
<br/>It forces you to think about the time required for your work – Most people have a to-do list, either on paper or using some kind of app. But this is just half the battle. One of the challenges in managing a to-do is that it’s very easy to over-commit. In other words, it’s easy to over budget too many tasks into your day or week. When you schedule time for these tasks and put them on your calendar, you’re forced to make a guess as to how long those tasks will take to complete. So, when you look at your list of 10 things to do today and fill the available time in your calendar with the first 5, 
<br/>you instantly know you can’t get everything done and have to re-plan. By taking the time to think about how long tasks will take to complete, you’re able to approach your projects and tasks in a much more realistic way.
<br/>It helps you to convert intention into action – Most people use their calendars for important, time-sensitive events like meetings or phone calls. These are usually situations where you’ve made a commitment to someone else to turn up at a specific time and give them your attention. When you time block, you’re applying the same commitment to yourself. You’re making a promise to turn up at 10am and work on that presentation. This self-commitment helps you to turn good intention (the tasks on your task list) into a plan of action (a commitment about when you're going to get the work done).
<br/>It helps to prevent procrastination – Continuing from this last point, when you make this commitment to yourself, it helps to prevent procrastination. In his best-selling book, Influence, author Dale Carnegie discusses the power of consistency. He points out how people feel a need to remain consistent with what they say and follow through with promises. After you’ve blocked out time for an appointment on your calendar, this need to remain consistent with your plan helps you to overcome any distractions that might be causing you to procrastinate so you can execute and do the work.
<br/>It creates a record of how you spent your time – 
After you’ve done your work, it’s useful to be able to look back over your week and see how you spent your time. 
<br/>The more you understand about how your time is being spent, the more likely you are to make smart decisions and create better plans for the future.


# How to block your time
<br/>
Step one – I like to do the bulk of my time blocking on a Friday afternoon at the end of my working week. By planning the upcoming week I can more effectively switch off and relax at the weekend knowing I have a clear plan of attack for the new week. It also means I can get straight into actually doing the work on Monday morning. If Friday afternoons aren’t an option, aim for first thing Monday morning.
<br/>
Step two – You need to start with a clear list of tasks to work on. If you haven’t already got this, spend some time getting your thoughts out of your head and organising everything you need to do into projects.
<br/>
Step three – With a clear list of things to do, I suggest working through them in chronological order i.e.
<br/>start with Monday, then Tuesday and so on… and for each task 1) estimate how long the task will take to complete, then 2) block out time for this task on your calendar.


I don’t bother to schedule tasks for quick 5-minute things and small reminders.
<br/>But anything takes 15 minutes or longer should really be scheduled.
<br/>
Estimating how long a task will take to complete isn’t always easy. 
<br/>I always aim to schedule too much time for a task rather than too little. 
<br/>It’s much easier to finish early, adjust your calendar (more on this below)  
 <br/>and move on to the next thing rather than trying to rush through everything so you can stick to your plan.
<br/>It’s okay to schedule a few appointments back to back over the space of an hour or two. But avoid blocking out your entire day where there’s no space between tasks for short breaks. It’s good to budget in some “transition time” where you may check your email, follow up with colleagues, or take a quick tea/toilet break.
For certain tasks, you may need to schedule multiple time blocks over a few days.
<br/>
Let’s say you want to publish a blog post on Thursday. In that case, you may need a few blocks of time on Monday and Tuesday to write the post, a block on Wednesday for edits and time on Thursday for publishing.
Aim to leave some blank space in your calendar each day as you’ll more than likely need this room for urgent tasks that come up later.
