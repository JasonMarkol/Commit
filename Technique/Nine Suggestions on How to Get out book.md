Nine Suggestions on How to Get the Most Out of This Book 
1. If you wish to get the most out of this book, there is one indispensable requirement, one essential infinitely more important than any rules or techniques. Unless you have this one fundamental requisite a thousand rules on how to study will avail little. And if you do have this cardinal endowment, then you can achieve wonders without reading any suggestions for getting the most out of a book. 

What is this magic requirement? Just this: a deep, driving desire to learn, a vigorous determination to stop worrying and start living. 

How can you develop such an urge? By constantly reminding yourself of how important these principles are to you. Picture to yourself how their mastery will aid you in living a richer, happier life. Say to yourself over and over: “My peace of mind, my happiness, my health, and perhaps even my income will, in the long run, depend largely on applying the old, obvious, and eternal truths taught in this book.”

2. Read each chapter rapidly at first to get a bird’s-eye view of it. You will probably be tempted then to rush on to the next one. But don’t. Unless you are reading merely for entertainment. But if you are reading because you want to stop worrying and start living, then go back and reread each chapter thoroughly. In the long run, this will mean saving time and getting results. 

3. Stop frequently in your reading to think over what you are reading. Ask yourself just how and when you can apply each suggestion. That kind of reading will aid you far more than racing ahead like a whippet chasing a rabbit. 

4. Read with a red crayon, pencil, or pen in your hand; and when you come across a suggestion that you feel you can use, draw a line beside it. If it is a four-star suggestion, then underscore every sentence, or mark it with “XXXX.” Marking and underscoring a book make it far more interesting, and far easier to review rapidly. 

5. I know a woman who has been office manager for a large insurance concern for fifteen years. She reads every month all the insurance contracts her company issues. Yes, she reads the same contracts over month after month, year after year. Why? Because experience has taught her that that is the only way she can keep their provisions clearly in mind. 

I once spent almost two years writing a book on public speaking; and yet I find I have to keep going back over it from time to time in order to remember what I wrote in my own book. The rapidity with which we forget is astonishing. 

So, if you want to get a real, lasting benefit out of this book, don’t imagine that skimming through it once will suffice. After reading it thoroughly, you 
ought to spend a few hours reviewing it every month. Keep it on your desk in front of you every day. Glance through it often. Keep constantly impressing yourself with the rich possibilities for improvement that still lie in the offing. Remember that the use of these principles can be made habitual and unconscious only by a constant and vigorous campaign of review and application. There is no other way.

Bernard Shaw once remarked: “If you teach a man anything, he will never learn.” Shaw was right. Learning is an active process. We learn by doing. So, if you desire to master the principles you are studying in this book, do something about them. Apply these rules at every opportunity. If you don’t, you will forget them quickly. Only knowledge that is used sticks in your mind. You will probably find it difficult to apply these suggestions all the time. I know, because I wrote this book, and yet frequently I find it difficult to apply everything I have advocated here. So, as you read this book, remember that you are not merely trying to acquire information. You are attempting to form new habits. Ah yes, you are attempting a new way of life. That will require time and persistence and daily application. So refer to these pages often. Regard this as a working handbook on conquering worry; and when you are confronted with some trying problem—don’t get all stirred up. Don’t do the natural thing, the impulsive thing. That is usually wrong. Instead, turn to these pages and review the paragraphs you have underscored. Then try these new ways and watch them achieve magic for you. 

萧伯纳曾经说过：“如果你教一个人任何东西，他永远也学不会。”肖是正确的。学习是一个主动的过程。我们边干边学。所以，如果你渴望掌握在这本书中，你正在学习的原则，做一些他们。在每一个机会应用这些规则。如果你不这样做，你很快就会忘记他们。只有用棍子在你的心中的知识。你可能会发现很难将这些建议所有的时间。我知道，因为我写这本书，但我经常发现很难申请的一切，我在这里提倡的。因此，当你读这本书，请记住，你是不是只是想获取信息。您正试图形成新的习惯。是啊，您正在尝试新的生活的方式。这将需要时间和持久性和日常应用。所以，把这些网页经常。以此作为征服担心工作手册;当你面对一些试图解决问题的鸵鸟政策得到所有搅拌了起来。不要做自然的事，冲动的事情。这通常是错误的。相反，把这些网页和查看已经强调的段落。然后尝试这些新的方式，看他们实现的魔法给你。 


7. Offer your family members a quarter every time they catch you violating one of the principles advocated in this book. They will break you! 


8. Please turn to page 190 of this book and read how the Wall Street banker, H. P. Howell, and old Ben Franklin corrected their mistakes. Why don’t you use the Howell and Franklin techniques to check up on your application of the principles 
discussed in this book? If you do, two things will result. 

请翻到这本书的第190页，阅读如何华尔街银行家，HP霍威尔，老富兰克林纠正自己的错误。你为什么不使用豪威尔和富兰克林技术来检查你的应用原则 
在这本书中讨论？如果你这样做，有两件事情引起。 

First, you will find yourself engaged in an educational process that is both intriguing and priceless. Second, you will find that your ability to stop worrying and start living will grow and spread like a green bay tree. 

首先，你会发现自己在从事教育过程既有趣和无价的。其次，你会发现，你的能力，停止担忧并开始生活会生长和扩散像青翠树。 


9. Keep a diary—a diary in which you ought to record your triumphs in the application of these principles. Be specific. Give names, dates, results. Keeping such a record will inspire you to greater efforts; and how fascinating these entries will be when you chance upon them some evening, years from now! 

9.随身携带一本日记，日记中，你应该记录你的胜利在这些原则的应用。要具体。提供姓名，日期，结果。保持这样的记录将激励你更大的努力;而这些作品是如何迷人的将是，当你偶然在他们的一些日晚，几年从现在开始！
