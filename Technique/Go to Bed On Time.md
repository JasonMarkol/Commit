The typical adult requires 7-8 hours of sleep every night. Sleep is important for many reasons--it helps us consolidate what we learned during the day, it brings about the healing and repair of various tissues, and it allows us to feel rejuvenated and alert when we wake up. Despite the benefits of adequate sleep, most of us do not get enough.
This challenge aims to improve your sleeping habits--yes, it is a habit that needs to be developed. Determine what time you would like to wake up in the morning, and go to bed 7-8 hours before (plus an additional amount of time that it takes for you to fall asleep, approx. 10min for the average person). For people with poor sleep habits, this challenge will be extremely difficult at first. In an attempt to go to sleep on time, you might find yourself lying in bed for a prolonged period of time. However, your body will slowly adjust. For example, I used to go to bed between 1-2am when I was in college. Now, I have to wake up at 5am to go to work. I adjusted out of necessity, but it is useful regardless.
Some helpful tips: avoid excitatory stimuli before you plan on going to bed (TV, video games, etc.) These activities will keep your brain active for awhile. Avoid caffeine in the afternoon. Get f.lux for your computer to adjust the lighting of your monitor.
As always, please share your experience and any tips you might have for others.
