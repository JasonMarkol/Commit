00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,959
hey everyone this is Victor from growth
evolution development ground GED ground

2
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:09,269
comm the topic of today's video is 10
passive income ideas that you can apply

3
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:16,560
using your life to start earning passive
income now somebody may ask what is
passive income well the easiest way

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,750
probably to explain what passive income
is it's when you make money while you

5
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,039
sleep now you don't necessarily need to
make the money while you're sleeping but

6
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,570
the idea is that it's a good way to
illustrate that you don't have to do

7
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:40,350
anything continuously to earn that money
so you do certain amount of work at a

8
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:46,039
certain moment and you get continuously
paid for it even though you're not

9
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:52,620
working on it so unlike normal work
you're not exchanging an amount of hours
for a salary for money

10
00:00:54,809 --> 00:01:03,000
no you're exchanging the effort you put
into something for for money and you do

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,680
these things maybe once or twice or
however you know many hours you want to

12
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,150
spend on it and you don't have you don't
necessarily get paid at the same time

13
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:17,189
you can get paid tomorrow the next day
you know a week month year later that's
what passive income is it's not it's

14
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:23,759
like when money is flowing when your
while you're doing other things now why

15
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,869
did I even decide to make a video about
this well because more and more people

16
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:34,079
today realize that making money off the
internet is possible you we definitely

17
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,570
hear these stories of self-made
millionaires talk about how you know how

18
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,689
they made the money and how they make
money passively and we also see these

19
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:48,869
images of these fellows lying on the
beach and under the palm tree you know

20
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:54,869
drinking coconut milk out of the straw
and you know it says the laptop

21
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:59,189
lifestyle and I mean it's really amazing
and you're thinking like wow that's

22
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:04,259
pretty crazy that's super like I would
wanna I would want to experience this I

23
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:09,149
would want this to be my life but you
know it's really hard to imagine I mean

24
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:14,470
unless you were probably
like born in a family of millionaires

25
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:18,340
and you know it's just there for you
know it's really really hard to imagine

26
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:22,420
this because you know if you look around
and the majority of people maybe even
including you are going to work from

27
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:30,460
9:00 to 5:00 you know working in an
office living from you know on a monthly

28
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:35,500
salary and that's just how the majority
of people do obviously you also know

29
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,440
that people have their own businesses
you know they start their own companies

30
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,480
but usually what this means is like it's
you know how like you can brag I'm a CEO

31
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,490
I have my own company now instead of
working an eight-hour workday I work 10

32
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:54,610
hours a day for less money that's just
the sad reality of many businesses but

33
00:02:54,610 --> 00:03:00,490
at the same time there is this idea of
passive income when you don't have

34
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:04,450
necessarily your office and you're not
sitting there all the time and you're
still making the money it's crazy but

35
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:13,540
regardless of what anyone is going to
tell you it does exist and there are

36
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:18,640
people that do it the thing is that when
you see these in nice nice images don't

37
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,390
necessarily you know think that that's
what they do 100 percent of the time

38
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:27,880
just lie on the beach drinking coconut
no they these people probably work their

39
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,870
asses off they did triple the amount of
work everybody else does because you

40
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:35,890
know we work at just that our day job we
come home and we can rest no these
people can they maybe spent like you

41
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,830
know years just working just whole day
long to finally get to the place they

42
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:52,030
are at so don't be you know fooled by
these images but keep in mind that hard

43
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:57,400
you know work effort really always does
pay off and that's what a passive income

44
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:03,340
is about and it's also important to
remember that everybody was once a

45
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:09,010
beginner and you know by just having
this idea the belief that you know I can

46
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:12,850
do it someday you really do have the
possibility to do it just do some

47
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:18,280
research and you know you might it just
you know it might happen to you if

48
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:22,450
you're willing to put the amounts of
work in it and remember you know every

49
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:26,060
single action in life
begins with a thought so put that

50
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:30,199
thought out there that these things
exist and go check it out you know what

51
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:37,130
what can you do but in any case to help
you a little bit out maybe mmm - kind of

52
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:42,470
like gilc you get started I have found
10 things that you can do to start

53
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:46,520
earning passive income to start getting
the touch of it the feel and some of
these things I do myself while some of

54
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:53,509
these things I have researched and/or
you know they're really doable now the

55
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:59,060
first thing that I want to talk about is
called Kindle publishing now Kindle

56
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:02,660
publishing is something you do through
the Amazon platform and it basically

57
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:08,510
means you're selling books to people to
their Kindle devices you know Kindle
devices this like digital book that

58
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:14,150
Amazon sells and you can create your own
book and publish it to their Kindle
devices where alternatively you can also

59
00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:21,500
publish your physical books there as
well and it's a so-called on-demand

60
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,970
service they have so you don't have to
actually like pay to get books and store

61
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:31,000
them somewhere no you just send them the
text and they print it whenever somebody

62
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,050
pays for it and you don't have to do
absolutely anything so all you have to

63
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:42,770
do is write the book once and they will
print it for you and and all they do is
they take a percentage of it but you

64
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:47,000
won't even notice that percentage
because you're not putting any effort

65
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,229
into it whatsoever you're relying on
your Beach and you're getting paid for

66
00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:55,159
your books now the thing is that your
you might be thinking oh I'm going to

67
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:59,780
have to write a book no you don't have
to because there are there you know it's

68
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:04,190
totally legitimate way to also make
money to hire ghost writers give them a

69
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:08,240
topic and you know they either help you
or they write the book for you and you

70
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:14,260
hold the rights for that book so Kindle
publishing is a really really popular

71
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:18,530
way to make passive income today and
that's what makes it super great and

72
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:22,699
also not very great because on the one
hand it has withstood the test of time

73
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:29,900
so it does earn people money like it
really can early thousands but because
it's so popular there is some people say

74
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,020
that it's very saturated the market that
meaning

75
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:40,120
there's many people doing and it's hard
to make money well from personal

76
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:45,280
experience I can say that if is your if
it's possible to make money in some way
there's always going to be competition

77
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:50,979
so straightaway forget about this thing
where you can you know where you might
be thinking that I'm going to make money

78
00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:56,020
and probably nobody else knows about
this and it will be you know if nobody

79
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:59,650
else knows about this
you're either super lucky because you

80
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:04,830
know you just like accidentally randomly
found out about this thing or it's not

81
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:09,880
making a lot of money to people it's
just not very popular but anyway this is

82
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:14,259
a very good way to begin selling things
online if you want to know what passive

83
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:20,440
income is and how it feels now the pros
of it of doing Kindle publishing is that

84
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:25,270
it's very newbie friendly and you need
minimal investment you don't maybe even

85
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:28,630
need any investment if you want to just
sit down write your own book it doesn't

86
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:35,289
need to be long maybe like 40 60 pages
and you know for a small price just let

87
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:43,150
people buy it and and yeah it's just as
simple as that and it can potentially

88
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:48,190
earn you thousands now the cons it's
difficult to scale up to a large

89
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:52,870
business so it's more something like you
can you know a really great site income

90
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:57,039
a big site income but not something like
you can probably feed your feed your

91
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:02,830
whole family with forever you know now
passive income number two merch by

92
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:09,819
Amazon again Amazon and this opportunity
is really one-of-a-kind and you know why

93
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:15,580
because it costs you absolutely nothing
and at the same time it can make you
thousands and the idea of merch by

94
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:23,139
Amazon is selling t-shirts through the
Amazon platform again and the same thing

95
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:29,830
as with Kindle publishing it's on demand
meaning that whenever somebody perches

96
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:37,180
the purchases this t-shirt they printed
only them now the only thing that you

97
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:42,398
need to do is to learn how to use
Photoshop or GIMP or whatever program

98
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,040
you excuse me

99
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,160
yeah there was a notification on my
phone the only thing you need to do is
learn how to use Photoshop or GIMP to

100
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:57,130
make these designs or you hire someone
to make these designs that really will

101
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:03,280
sell so the pros of this thing it's
absolutely free but can earn you

102
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:08,080
thousands and also again one other thing
is that you can apply for which I

103
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,070
recommend you to do go to merch by
Amazon and apply for the program right

104
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:16,810
now but the thing is that you don't get
accepted straightaway it can take from a
month to six months you know to for them

105
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:24,430
to accept you because think about it
either do people are just easily you

106
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,970
know applying there and because they
don't need to pay anything and they're

107
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:32,230
just making a bunch of designs and
earning money for it so that's kind of

108
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:36,450
like the con of it that you have to wait
for some time but again also I mean

109
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:41,830
you're not wasting anything for it so
why not go and try it out anyway so I

110
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:49,180
really recommend you to register for it
and so yeah that was number two number
three Amazon FBA now I was not happy

111
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:56,410
again as you can you know see from the
name

112
00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:01,990
god bless Amazon it's something you do
through the Amazon platform and this one

113
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:06,940
is about selling physical products to
Amazon and if they means fulfillment by

114
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:12,850
Amazon and what they do is that well
what you do is that you get physical

115
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:18,850
products you ship them to Amazon
warehouses and that's it the rest Amazon

116
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:24,280
does it for that for you so they fulfill
the things for you they they ship the

117
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:29,710
your product to clients they handle
customer support and you know they

118
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:35,140
handle returns and if you don't
understand how how good this is you know

119
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:41,620
I can't even explain it because customer
support can take so much time so much

120
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:46,720
energy out of you handling returns all
that stuff is crazy and you know luckily

121
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,580
Amazon you know is nice enough to do
that for you now obviously they're going

122
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,670
to take a percentage of that for
themselves because you know well that's
how they earn money also but this is a

123
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:02,250
great opportunity
and it's something that I have started

124
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:06,960
doing and I'm really happy about and
I'll have a video linked to in the end

125
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:14,250
of this video to my experience with this
with Amazon Abbey now the pros this is a

126
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,430
proper business that you can do it's
scalable

127
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:22,080
and it can earn you hundreds of
thousands of dollars if you you know if

128
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:28,590
you really take it seriously now the
cons it will require decent amount of

129
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:32,670
income to start with because you do need
to get those physical products you do
need to ship them into you know the US

130
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:39,840
or Europe or wherever you want to into
the warehouses and it's also quite

131
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:45,450
difficult to start with if you have no
experience with selling online but again

132
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:50,310
it's totally possible and as you just
noted a motivated enough you can find an
online course to teach you that's what I

133
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,510
did
just find an online course they teach

134
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:59,220
you how to do it and you know you just
start doing it obviously we'll need to

135
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,700
save up a little bit if you don't have
the money to actually have enough to

136
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:08,880
purchase those products so that's Amazon
FBA a really good opportunity also now

137
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:14,910
number four affiliate marketing
affiliate marketing is a totally also

138
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:20,430
legit way of making passive income it's
basically when you advertise products or

139
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:26,190
services you like for other to other
people and you get paid a commission for

140
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:33,480
well for people buying these things
through your links now this is a really

141
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,890
nice way to earn passive income but the
thing is that as you can imagine you

142
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:43,350
need people to you need a following you
need people to advertise the products to

143
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:48,270
to you know you either need to have a
social media following or your own

144
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:53,360
website or blog somewhere really where
people are going to be attracted to and

145
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,850
consume your content and you know be
happy to purchase the things you're

146
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:07,680
recommending to them so this is a good
also really good way to start a business
especially because well the pros of it

147
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:16,200
is that you if we
quire's little to no money if you're

148
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:20,970
doing it on a social media then you know
put out some content that people will

149
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:24,930
really enjoy and I'll just subscribe and
you know sooner or later start or start
earning passive income or if you have a

150
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:30,930
blog or website all you need to do is
just you know pay for hosting which is

151
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:34,680
not very expensive have your website
start writing straightaway start putting

152
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:39,329
out content on any topic and if you're
consistent sooner or later you will have

153
00:13:39,329 --> 00:13:44,730
people coming to your website to check
the stuff out that you have now it's

154
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:49,320
really easy to get started with but the
cons is that it can take you a long time

155
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,040
before you will start earning anything
so it really does require a lot of
consistent work that you have to do over

156
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:00,240
time continuously and it's not
necessarily something that's going to

157
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,839
make you a millionaire but it's also a
really good way to make some passive

158
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,680
income and it can there are people that
make hundreds and thousands of dollars
you know this way but they are really

159
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:15,779
like you know it's not like everybody
can get to that level but in any case

160
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:20,820
like I said it all starts here with the
belief and maybe you can do some more

161
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,820
research and expand on this and maybe
this is something you're going to want

162
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:29,160
to do now number five rental property I
don't do rental property but this is
just so common and again has withstood

163
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:35,760
the test of time and so many people do
it it requires a lot of money but the

164
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,760
idea is that you buy an apartment and
you rent it out to people and this is a

165
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:46,079
the pros of this that it's a stable way
to make passive income it can make your

166
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,740
relatively high amount of money
depending on how many properties you

167
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,880
have rental properties but the cons of
it is that it requires a decent amount

168
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:59,250
of knowledge in order to make you know
the right moves and you know you need to

169
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:03,750
know the market and everything so this
is also kind of advanced and you need a

170
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:08,640
lot of money to start with with this
kind of a business to make passive

171
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:14,160
income now number six create an online
course now there's website maybe you've

172
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,810
heard of like udemy which offers just
you know different courses and some

173
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:23,160
courses cost less some courses cost more
but the idea is like you make a course

174
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:29,799
and
you read people bias now I think if it's

175
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:35,649
a good way to make passive income but I
have I I personally think that you

176
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:40,629
shouldn't make a course just because you
can I think it because there's a there's

177
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:44,499
a gazillion crappy courses out there and
you don't want to be the gazillion and

178
00:15:44,499 --> 00:15:48,910
first just a trashy course know if you
really are knowledgeable on something if

179
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:52,269
you really have something you really
well know when you want to share with

180
00:15:52,269 --> 00:15:56,679
the world then by all means go ahead and
make that course it's really for people

181
00:15:56,679 --> 00:16:00,790
like you you know to share something
useful with the world but if you don't

182
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:06,100
have something to share then you know
maybe you shouldn't go into this now the

183
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:12,459
pros of this is that it can make you
money rather quickly and it's you can
really enjoy the process because it's

184
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:18,819
you're doing something you love like you
know something like I don't know maybe

185
00:16:18,819 --> 00:16:21,879
you're teaching people how to play the
guitar so it's something that's really

186
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:24,999
natural to you and you're getting paid
to do it passively

187
00:16:24,999 --> 00:16:31,839
and sometimes it also requires no cost
to get into so it's these are the pros

188
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:37,449
and the cons is that you need to know
the subject and it won't probably make
you too rich because I mean you can't

189
00:16:40,689 --> 00:16:45,549
make the course is too expensive right
well I mean you can but you have to be

190
00:16:45,549 --> 00:16:51,759
really really good them now passive
income ideas seven create an online

191
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:56,679
course with a month monthly membership
fee mmm this already sounds a little

192
00:16:56,679 --> 00:17:00,999
better but there's a little catch to
this it's not usually when people have

193
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:05,289
these membership courses with you know
monthly fees it's not something they

194
00:17:05,289 --> 00:17:08,949
hope they do on these websites like you
did me you know where there's a

195
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:14,169
collection of of course is where anybody
can put on their course no it's more

196
00:17:14,169 --> 00:17:20,740
like a real business you have your own
website you have your own customer

197
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:25,959
support and you kind of you know if it's
a monthly membership fee as you

198
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:31,389
understand probably you need to make
content from time to time because that's
how you're going to well that's how you

199
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,210
why would people otherwise you want to
pay monthly you know for

200
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:41,320
but if you keep adding some new content
and that's really good then people are

201
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:47,770
definitely gonna pay for it now it all
it sounds like a lot of work you know

202
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:52,120
hiring a person to do the customer
support and you do really want that

203
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,910
customer support because you can't
imagine you know if there's like four

204
00:17:54,910 --> 00:18:00,160
hundred people signing up and someone
somebody wants to return somebody wants

205
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,970
help and there is nobody to help them
know they're gonna you know just they're

206
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:09,220
not going to be there for long and so
you do need to probably most likely hire

207
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:13,450
cuz you know somebody to help you with
the customer support you do need to get

208
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:16,720
that website running and stuff like that
and you do need to make the course

209
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,120
itself but it's the hard work as I said
in the beginning it's something you do
maybe in the beginning like in this case

210
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:28,840
and then once the core of the course is
done it's also much easier from there

211
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:33,160
your site is up your customer support is
there and you're just you know adding

212
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:37,330
the content which is so much easier than
you know starting from scratch so keep
that in mind but again the thing is

213
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:46,230
these kind of membership courses this is
what can make you really rich these are

214
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:52,000
these are like proper business up
business ideas and this is also a way to

215
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,030
make passive income now the pros it can
make you a lot of money it's also when

216
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:01,900
you when you do that something you
something that you love and you get paid

217
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:07,750
for it and on a regular basis because
it's a monthly membership fee and it's

218
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:12,880
also rather cheap during you again needs
a website hosting and you will you need

219
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,600
to pay somebody to do the customer
support alternatively you could even do
it on your own but I wouldn't recommend

220
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:21,310
that but it's still rather cheap to
start with if you compared to some other

221
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:27,340
businesses now the cons you need to know
the subject again and you may need to

222
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:31,120
spend a lot of time time advertising
your course because it's not going to be

223
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,440
hosted on any particular site already
that's popular that's known like you did

224
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,090
me it's not it's your own website that
you need to kind of show to the world so
it will take time to bring it up and to

225
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:48,160
let other people find out about it
and you will need to put out new content

226
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,540
regularly so you have to keep that in
mind and you will yeah and you will most
likely need customer support now

227
00:19:55,540 --> 00:20:02,020
passive income number idea number eight
make a youtube channel now if you're not

228
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:05,380
afraid of going into the public and you
really love to be in front of the

229
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:10,810
cameras and this is a great opportunity
but keep in mind that making money on
YouTube doesn't happen straightaway you

230
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:18,070
need to become popular and there's a lot
of people today becoming popular and and

231
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:22,930
not everybody has you know the content
that other people like you can go on

232
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:26,650
YouTube and you if you know you've
probably seen people you know cutting

233
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:31,750
coke bottles with like a really warm
knife and that kind of stuff you know

234
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:37,930
gets millions of views and then you have
somebody like me just kidding you have

235
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:41,890
somebody talking just about things and
you know they're kind of interesting and

236
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:45,280
you know they don't get so many views
because the majority of people just like
short videos that are funnier you know

237
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:50,800
easy to watch and I totally agree with
this I I myself spend a lot of time just

238
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:57,220
watching you know kind of like quick
videos I think it's a great way to relax

239
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:03,700
and but yeah if you think that you have
some kind of content idea that you

240
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:07,540
people would like then go out there and
do it

241
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:14,590
and um and you might think also that
recently YouTube is being cutting on on

242
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:19,600
like it hasn't been paying so well to
its content creators you know due to

243
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,590
some problems with advertising
advertisements but you can get with time

244
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:28,620
your own sponsorships and other people
paying you for you talking for you

245
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:32,770
mentioning their name in your video so
it doesn't necessarily need to come

246
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:37,300
directly from YouTube so this is also a
great way to make passive income if

247
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:42,820
you're into into being filming into
filming yourself and just filming other

248
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:48,850
things and now the pros if you love to
being on camera then you will love this

249
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:54,760
and you can start this with no or
minimal investment so you can use your

250
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:58,270
phone camera to
even make videos in the beginning now

251
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:03,400
the concepts that you need to make new
content regularly and the income is not

252
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,840
stable it fluctuates you never know how
much exactly you're going to get this in
the next month and another funny econ is

253
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:17,550
that be ready to get some criticism to
meet those keyboard warriors these sofa

254
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:21,790
experts and just haters of the comments
section it's pretty normal people like

255
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:29,590
to diss other people when you don't know
they're two right entity now number nine

256
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:33,760
sell your photograph there's a bunch of
website that will sell your photograph

257
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,590
for you and this is a great way if you
really want love to be creative but you

258
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:42,130
don't want to film yourself so you don't
have to show yourself and the

259
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:46,090
photography is always being your hobby
why not why not you know ask money for
it now the pros is that if you love

260
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:52,600
photography before then you will like
this will be like a walk in the park and

261
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:57,880
it allows you to be creative if that's
what you're you know like nature is and

262
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:02,890
the cons of this it will require an
expensive camera because these images

263
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:08,080
really need to be of high quality and
will not necessarily make you a lot of
money also it will fluctuate so this is

264
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:14,920
not a way to become a millionaire
definitely unless you're a full-time you

265
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,220
know professional photographer but
that's a different story this is more

266
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:24,070
like you do something as a hobby and you
sell your photographs I will have some

267
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:29,710
websites that you can use to sell your
photographs in the blog so if you go

268
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:34,390
through this video's description to my
blog you know post that's attached this

269
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:39,010
video where I have some links like you
did me and a bunch of websites where you

270
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:45,310
can sell your photos now um number 10
the last passive income idea is build a

271
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:49,660
website and do whatever with it now I
talked earlier about affiliate marketing

272
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:54,520
where you promote your well you
advertise things through your website or

273
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:58,630
social media but you don't necessarily
need to you know rely only on affiliate

274
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:03,870
links you can create a website on any
topic you want whether it's you know
science animal care

275
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:15,670
parenting whatever it is or you know
just any kind of a blog and just keep

276
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:19,990
putting out content and with time you
will get a following and then you can do

277
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:23,560
whatever you want you can put you can
connect it to Google Adsense so you know

278
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:27,340
you have these little Google advertising
banners all around your website when

279
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:32,650
people click you get paid for it
where you can also do you know affiliate

280
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:36,970
marketing where you can even sell your
own products through your website it's

281
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:40,180
really up to you because you know having
your own website is like having your own

282
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:45,040
shop it's kind of like your own business
and this is something that can

283
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:48,910
definitely depending on how smart your
with it this is something that can

284
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:55,890
easily with time replace your day job
and can you know allow you to earn some

285
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:59,560
1,200 of thousands depending on what
you're doing with your website if you're
selling physical products it's a really

286
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:09,160
good way to make money now the thing is
that this is a really nice idea but you

287
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:14,830
have to be ready to put in a lot of hard
work because it takes time to for your
website to be noticed on the internet

288
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,340
it's not like overnight they know you
will have to be consistent you know
sometimes it can take years of

289
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:27,700
consistent work and in the beginning you
will see maybe like no results

290
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:32,140
whatsoever but it comes with time and
you know you just have to remind

291
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:38,080
yourself that you know you have a bigger
plan and that you have to be happy about
even the little successes and as long as

292
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:44,230
you keep these things in mind that you
know there's nothing really stopping you

293
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:49,270
from becoming big sooner or later now
the pros of this is that it's cheap to

294
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:55,000
start with again website hosting and can
be basically a hobby of yours turned

295
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,840
into a lifestyle like if you're really
into you know dogs you can have a

296
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:03,850
website totally dedicated to dog
products and you know the way to train

297
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:10,150
dogs and you know just something you
love and can earn you thousands and

298
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:16,660
replace your day job eventually and now
the cons a lot of like I said a lot of

299
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:21,130
hard work needed with
maybe no visible results at first and

300
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:25,990
it's something that with time you may
lose your interest in you know because

301
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:29,740
it does take a long time and who knows
if you're you know today you really like

302
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:33,700
this thing that you're writing about
maybe next year you won't like like it

303
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:38,110
at all anymore
so keep these things in mind but in any
case I think these are ten pretty good

304
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:44,470
ways to earn passive income some are
easier than the other ones some you can

305
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:49,630
start doing right now like writing your
own book and or registering for merch by

306
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:56,020
Amazon but remember that keep in mind
that these things are possible and the
idea is not to become like you know

307
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:03,039
totally free of work like it's all
passive income I don't expect it to be

308
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:07,059
that you're going to sit and do nothing
no all of these as you probably noticed

309
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:11,140
required work some require a lot of work
but the idea is that you're not going to

310
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:17,350
exchange the amount of hours you sit in
an office for for money no here
the idea is to if you want to is to

311
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:26,169
leave this normal employment kind of
lifestyle not to sit from 9:00 to 5:00

312
00:27:26,169 --> 00:27:31,600
every day in a cubicle and you know live
from salary to salary and know you can
change all of this if you want to the

313
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:40,150
trick is the whole idea behind it is
that not everybody is doing it because

314
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:45,190
it's not so easy it's not normal it's so
much easier just to go to work but if

315
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:49,870
you're motivated and not there's nothing
to stop you from achieving this the
question is then are you willing to put

316
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:59,470
that work into it are you willing to put
all that effort and change your life and

317
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:06,340
if the answer is yes then it's good it's
good there should be nothing to stop you

318
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:10,179
just keep thinking about it that
positive thinking keep pushing yourself

319
00:28:10,179 --> 00:28:17,500
do some research and start start doing
it start doing it today now I hope you
