00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,319
improvement pill here I'm sure all of us
at one point or another have told

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,680
ourselves promised ourselves that we get
something done

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,099
maybe we told ourselves that we'd finish
that essay by the end of the week

4
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:14,790
maybe we told ourselves that we'd start
hitting the gym this summer or maybe we

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:19,170
even told ourselves that we'd finish
that book some youtuber suggested we

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,699
read but often times we find ourselves
not doing the things that we set out to

7
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:27,240
do and that's not good it's never good
when you say something and you
contradict it it hurts your self-esteem

8
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:34,320
so today we're gonna be talking about
exactly how to actually do what you say

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,950
that you're going to do and the best way
for me to do so is by referring to a

10
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,149
study that was published in the British
Journal of health psychology this study

11
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:46,559
looked at a group of 250 people who were
separated into three different groups

12
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,670
the first group was told to follow an
exercise routine for the next two weeks

13
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,719
the second group was told the same thing
as the first group but they were also

14
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,100
shown videos and clips about the
benefits of exercise this group was

15
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,539
called the motivated group and these
videos served as the motivation the

16
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,439
third and final group was told the same
thing as the first group they were also
shown the same exact videos as group

17
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,490
number two but on top of all of that
they filled out the following sentence I

18
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:21,020
will partake in at least 20 minutes of
vigorous exercise at blank place at

19
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:26,880
blank time this concept is called
implementation intention basically when

20
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,720
you write down the conditions of
completing a task so let's take a look

21
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,549
at the results of this experiment out of
the first group 38 percent of the people

22
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:40,710
exercised at least once a week for the
next two weeks out of the second group
which was the group that was shown

23
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:47,729
motivational videos only 35 percent of
them exercised at least once a week for

24
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:52,020
the next two weeks so it seems
motivational videos don't really do much

25
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,670
and might actually be counterproductive
and finally the third group the group

26
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:01,350
that used implementation intention had a
whopping 91 percent of their

27
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,490
participants hitting the gym at least
once a week for the next two weeks that

28
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:10,440
is significantly higher than the other
two groups and it goes to show just how

29
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,330
effective implementation intent
is now there have been hundreds of

30
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:18,350
studies looking at the effectiveness of
implementation intention there have been
Studies on dieting Studies on making

31
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,900
reading into a habit Studies on working
and all of them point to the fact that

32
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:28,520
implementation intention is extremely
effective in terms of getting you to do

33
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:33,800
the things you say you're going to do
now the question remains why why does

34
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,570
writing down a short little sentence
which takes no more than a minute do so
much well think of it this way let's say

35
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:45,140
for example you're someone who wants to
start a new exercise habit you'll often
find that you'll wait around for the

36
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:50,960
right moment the perfect opportunity
where you're filled with motivation to

37
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:56,030
go and hit the gym and more often than
not that moment never comes the majority

38
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:00,470
of people are simply not filled with
motivation all of the time however when

39
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:05,270
you write down exactly when and where
you will exercise it changes everything

40
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:09,740
you no longer have to wait for
motivation because you've already set an

41
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:13,490
appointment see studies have actually
found that in terms of willpower it

42
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:18,200
actually takes more willpower to make
the decision of going to the gym than
the actual workout itself it takes more

43
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:25,520
willpower to put on your shoes and step
out of your door than the actual workout

44
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,940
so if you make the decision beforehand
you save yourself from having to spend

45
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:34,010
willpower on the day of and this makes
the process of hitting the gym much

46
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:38,630
easier especially after a long day of
work where your levels of willpower are

47
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,720
already low so for those of you that
want to stick to a habit or get

48
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,470
something done I suggest you take
advantage of this trick so what I like

49
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:49,240
for you to do in the comments below is
to write out your own implementation

50
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:53,780
intention let me know what it is that
you'd like to accomplish and when and

51
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,020
where you're going to do it something
important to note is that you should

52
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:02,000
make your implementation intention as
reasonable as possible if you have a big

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,590
task like an essay that needs to be done
break it down so instead of saying I'll

54
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:10,640
complete my essay at the library
tomorrow at 5 p.m. it's more effective
to say I'll write the first two

55
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:17,780
paragraphs of my essay at the library
tomorrow starting at 5 p.m. the simpler

56
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:21,589
the task the less of a chance you'll
avoid it this episode is brought to you

57
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:24,770
with the help of our betrayed betrayed
is a crypto currency trading platform

58
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:28,970
and for those of you that don't know
what cryptocurrencies are they are a new

59
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,600
form of currency that operates
independent of a central bank that means

60
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,410
no country or bank has control over it
some of the popular cryptocurrencies

61
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:40,970
right now are Bitcoin aetherium and
litecoin all of which I've invested

62
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:45,680
heavily in I personally believe that
eventually humanity will operate on a

63
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,450
global currency and cryptocurrencies
seem like a reasonable candidate however

64
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:54,500
it's hard to say exactly which
cryptocurrency will have a place in the

65
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,410
future of mankind
so it's something I'd suggest you look

66
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:01,460
into further in your own time average
trade is a reputable platform for any of
you that are interested in getting in on

67
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:06,560
some of this action one of the good
things about trading cryptocurrencies is

68
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,130
that there are no fees and with
arbitrate you can start off with as

69
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:14,390
little as $100 and just to be clear when
you trade on arbitrate you are not

70
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:18,050
buying coins you are trading on the
price of these coins so for those of you

71
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:21,950
that are interested in cryptocurrencies
I suggest you head on over to arbitrate
