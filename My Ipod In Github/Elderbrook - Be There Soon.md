[Verse 1]
You hit the coast
But I'm out by midnight
I'm feeling low
The high tides lit bright by the streetlight
I'll be there soon
Crash the waves that the water makes for you
I'll be there soon
I'll be there soon

[Chorus]
I'll be there soon
(Oh I'll be)
Crash the waves that the water makes for you
(If you want me)
I'll be there soon
(Oh I'll be)
I'll be there soon
(If you want)

[Verse 2]
Oh you're too caught up
(too caught up, caught up)
We was right or not
All this wondering love
(love, love)
[?]
 

[Chorus x2]
I'll be there soon
(Oh I'll be)
Crash the waves that the water makes for you
(If you want me to) / (If you want me)
I'll be there soon
(Oh I'll be)
I'll be there soon
(If you want me to) / (If you want me)

[Verse 3]
Outside (outside)
You're alright (alright)
Hold tight
Won't you hold tight?

[Chorus x2]
'll be there soon
(Oh I'll be)
Crash the waves that the water makes for you
(If you want me to)
I'll be there soon
(Oh I'll be)
I'll be there soon
(If you want) / (If you want me to)
 

I'll be there soon x4
