# 歌词

[Verse 1]
When did we get so lost inside ourselves?
We used to be strong, now it's like we don't care
Instead we're calling out for help
Don't know where we went wrong, but it's so hard to share
(So hard to share)

[Pre-Chorus]
All this weight left on our shoulders
Too much for the both of us

[Chorus]
When did it get so heavy?
This love that's in between us
It never used to feel this
Feels so heavy (heavy)
Can't get up off the ground (up off the ground)
It's weighing us down

[Verse 2]
When did we get so bad at being honest?
You got things on your mind, that you don't wanna say
Thought that we had made a promise
That we would never get this way

[Pre-Chorus]
But all this weight left on our shoulders
Too much for the both of us

[Chorus]
When did it get so heavy?
This love that's in between us
It never used to feel this
Feels so heavy
Can't get up off the ground, yeah (up off the ground)
It's weighing us down
It's weighing us down
(So heavy, baby)

[Bridge]
All these things we said that we never meant
Are we gonna let them hold us down?
All these things we said that we never meant
Are we gonna let them hold us down, down?

[Chorus]
'Cause baby it's too heavy
This love that's in between us
We never used to feel this
Feels so heavy, uh
Can't get up off the ground
Can't get up off the ground
It's weighing us down
It's weighing us down, down, down

[Outro]
So heavy
It's weighing us down, down, down
No, no, no, no, na, na, na, na
So heavy
When did it get so, when did it get so heavy?
