《There's Something About Us Under The Sheets (Ellie Goulding vs Daft Punk)》歌词：
like all the boys before 
like all the boys, boys, boys
like all the boys before 
like all the boys, boys, boys
you left a blood stain on the floor 
you set your sights on him
you left a hand print on the door
like all the boys before
like all the boys before
this is our luck baby, running out
our clothes were never off
we still have our roads to run about
to scale the map
scale the map
to get us back on track
i've seen you in a fight you lost
i've seen you in a fight
we're under the sheets 
and you're killing me
in our house made of paper 
your words all over me
we're under the sheets and you're killing me
it might not be the right time
i might not be the right one
but there's something about us i want to say
'cause there's something between us anyway
it might not be the right time
i might not be the right one
but there's something about us i've gotta do
some kind of secret i will share with you
we're under the sheets 
and you're killing me
in our house made of paper 
your words all over me
we're under the sheets and you're killing me
in here the world won't bring us down
our plan is gold dust
out there a lonely girl can drown
in here we're frozen
where did the people go?
my hands are empty
you're not the answer i should know
like all the boys before
like all the boys before
we're under the sheets 
and you're killing me
in our house made of paper 
your words all over me
we're under the sheets and you're killing me
i need you more than anything in my life
i want you more than anything in my life
i miss you more than anyone in my life
i love you more than anyone in my life
