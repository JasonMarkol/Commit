《There's Something About Us Under The Sheets (Ellie Goulding vs Daft Punk)》歌词：
<br/>
like all the boys before <br/>
like all the boys, boys, boys<br/>
like all the boys before <br/>
like all the boys, boys, boys<br/>
you left a blood stain on the floor <br/>
you set your sights on him<br/>
you left a hand print on the door<br/>
like all the boys before<br/>
like all the boys before<br/>
this is our luck baby, running out<br/>
our clothes were never off<br/>
we still have our roads to run about<br/>
to scale the map<br/>
scale the map<br/>
to get us back on track<br/>
i've seen you in a fight you lost<br/>
i've seen you in a fight<br/>
we're under the sheets <br/>
and you're killing me<br/>
in our house made of paper <br/>
your words all over me<br/>
we're under the sheets and you're killing me<br/>
it might not be the right time<br/><br/>
i might not be the right one<br/>
but there's something about us i want to say<br/>
'cause there's something between us anyway<br/>
it might not be the right time<br/>
i might not be the right one<br/>
but there's something about us i've gotta do<br/>
some kind of secret i will share with you<br/>
we're under the sheets <br/>
and you're killing me<br/>
in our house made of paper <br/>
your words all over me<br/>
we're under the sheets and you're killing me<br/>
in here the world won't bring us down<br/>
our plan is gold dust<br/>
out there a lonely girl can drown<br/>
in here we're frozen<br/>
where did the people go?<br/>
my hands are empty<br/>
you're not the answer i should know<br/>
like all the boys before<br/>
like all the boys before<br/>
we're under the sheets <br/>
and you're killing me<br/>
in our house made of paper <br/>
your words all over me<br/>
we're under the sheets and you're killing me<br/>
i need you more than anything in my life<br/>
i want you more than anything in my life<br/>
i miss you more than anyone in my life<br/>
i love you more than anyone in my life<br/>
