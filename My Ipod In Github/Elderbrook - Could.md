Went on, for just a little too long
Went wrong, when you had to give up your gun
No change, the only thing that you should
It's okay, if you want to switch up you could

If you want to switch out you could (could, could)
If you want to switch out you could (could, could)
(Could, could, could)
If you want to switch out you could
If you want to switch out you could (could, could)
(Could, could, could)

My head is numb, we shop, we're dumb
And I see myself in this
Too far it seems, you don't agree
You need your place in this

Went on, for just a little too long
Went wrong, when you had to give up your gun
No change, the only thing that you should
It's okay, if you want to switch up you could

If you want to switch up you could
If you want to switch out you could

These cards we deal, they hold so still
I see myself in this
If you must walk in like that again
You got no place in this

Went on, for just a little too long
Went wrong, when you had to give up your gun
No change, the only thing that you should
It's okay, if you want to switch up you could

You want to switch out you could
If you want to switch out you could (could, could)
(Could, could, could)
If you want to switch out you could (could, could)
(Could, could, could)
