Open your eyes, eyes and see.
what is meant, is meant to be,
open your eyes, eyes and see,

what is meant, to be
its written
words dont mean a thing
thats where anything
the sunshine just for you
im waiting
to tell you how i feel
it could be any one day, when i could just say open your eyes and see the sunshine
open your eyes, eyes and see
what is meant, is meant to be,
open your eyes, eyes and see
what is meant, to be
im sittin,
never felt alone before,
in between my thoughts, the sun shine dont shine no more,
stalking, your position,
but the words i just cannot find
so my heart my bleeds for you i need to open your eyes and see them stars
open your eyes, eyes and see,
what is meant, is meant to be,
open your eyes, eyes and see,
what is meant, to be
just...
