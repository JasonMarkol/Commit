池塘边的榕树上
知了在声声叫着夏天
操场边的秋千上
只有蝴蝶停在上面
黑板上老师地粉笔
还在拼命唧唧喳喳写个不停
等待着下课
等待着放学
等待游戏的童年
福利社里面什么都有
就是口袋里没有半毛钱
诸葛四郎和魔鬼党
到底谁抢到那只宝剑
隔壁班的那个女孩
怎么还没经过我的窗前
嘴里的零食
手里的漫画
心里初恋的童年
总是要等到睡觉前
才知道功课只做了一点点
总是要等到考试后
才知道该念的书都没有念
一寸光阴一寸金
老师说过寸金难买寸光阴
一天又一天一年又一年
迷迷糊糊地童年
music...
没有人知道为什么
太阳总下到山的那一边
没有人能够告诉我
山里面有没有住着神仙
多少的日子里总是
一个人面对着天空发呆
就这么好奇
就这么幻想
这么孤单的童年
阳光下蜻蜓飞过来
一片一片绿油油的稻田
水彩蜡笔和万花筒
画不出天边那一道彩虹
什么时候才能像高年级
地同学有张成熟与长大的脸
盼望着假期
盼望着明天
盼望长大的童年
一天又一天一年又一年
盼望长大的童年
Days on my past 
原唱:baishi-kle 
I recall when I was young OH， 
I will play and always having fun 
with the neighbour next to me 
And we’ll play until the setting sun 
try to be The best among the others 
in a game call the “Spider battle” 
It doesn’t matter, 
who is the best how 
those were the days of my past 
few years later when I got to school and was late for lesson all the time 
Always day dreaming in the class 
till I don’t even know the lessons done 
Then my teacher always tell me 
never ever be lazy again 
what can I do now 
What can I say now 
Those were the days of my past 
As the days go on and on 
I grew up and had my first love 
candle light and sandy beach 
finally give away my first kiss 
mother said I was too young to fall in love and 
then I will one day regret so love was over 
but I do miss her 
those were the days of my past 
just when I left my high school and 
got my first job as a salesmen 
working hard all day and night 
no one there to lend a helping hand 
daddy told me not to worry and 
said that I should go on step by step 
what can I say now 
what can I do now 
those were the days of my past 
then once day I settled down with the only one I really love 
gona small family with two kid that is what I’m always hoping for 
But I still remember having fun with all my friends when I was young 
I miss my hometown I miss my old friend 
Those were the days of my past 
I miss my hometown I miss my old friend 
Those were the days of my past 
(When will I see them again)
