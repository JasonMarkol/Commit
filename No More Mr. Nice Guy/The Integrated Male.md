After enrolling in a No More Mr. Nice Guy! therapy group, Gil,   
a pleasant man in his early fifties revealed that his wife was supportive of his joining a group.   
Nevertheless, he harbored a secret fear that she would be angry at what the name of the group seemed to imply 
—   "How to stop being a Nice Guy and become an S.O.B." Using typical Nice Guy logic,  
Gil questioned why any woman would be supportive of men becoming "not nice."  <br/>
<br/>
  Because Nice Guys tend to be very black and white in their thinking, 
  the only alternative they can see to being nice is becoming "bastards" or "jerks."
  I frequently remind Nice Guys that the opposite of crazy is still crazy, so becoming a "jerk" isn't the answer.

Recovery from the Nice Guy Syndrome isn't about going from one extreme to another. 
The process of breaking free from ineffective Nice Guy patterns doesn't involve becoming "not nice." Rather, 
<h1>it means becoming "integrated."</h1> <br/>

Being integrated means <strong>being able to accept all aspects of one's self.   </strong>
An integrated man is able to embrace everything that makes him uniquely male: his power, his assertiveness, his courage, 
  and his passion as well as his imperfections, his mistakes, and his dark side.
  
  An integrated male possesses many of the following attributes: <br/>
  • He has a strong sense of self. He likes himself just as he is. <br/>
  • He takes responsibility for getting his own needs met. <br/>
  • He is comfortable with his masculinity and his sexuality. <br/>
  • He has integrity. He does what is right, not what is expedient.<br/>
  • He is a leader. He is willing to provide for and protect those he cares about. • He is clear, direct, and expressive of his feelings.<br/> 
  • He can be nurturing and giving without caretaking or problem-solving. <br/>
  • He knows how to set boundaries and is not afraid to work through conflict.<br/>
  
  An integrated male doesn't strive to be perfect or gain the approval of others. 
  Instead he accepts himself just as he is, warts and all. <strong>An integrated male accepts that he is perfectly imperfect.</strong>
  <br/>
  
  Making the transformation from a Nice Guy to an integrated male doesn't come about by just trying harder to be a good man.
    Breaking free from the Nice Guy Syndrome demands embracing a totally different way of viewing oneself and the world, 
    a complete change in one's personal paradigm.
