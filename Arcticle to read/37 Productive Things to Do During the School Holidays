1. Reflect on the semester gone by.

Take out a sheet of paper and answer these three questions:
‚Ä¢What did I do well in the past semester?
‚Ä¢What did I not do so well in the past semester?
‚Ä¢What will I do differently in the coming semester?

2. Set process goals for the coming semester.

This is a follow-up to Point #1.

Set process goals for the coming semester instead of performance goals, because process goals are far more effective.

What‚Äôs the difference between the two types of goals?

Process goals are what you intend to do, while performance goals are what you intend to achieve.

Here‚Äôs an example.

Performance goal: Get an A for math next semester.

Process goal: Do three extra math questions every day after dinner.

By setting process goals, you‚Äôre more likely to take action than if you only set performance goals.

So take some time and set 5 to 10 process goals for the coming semester.

3. Watch educational YouTube videos.


YouTubebSave

Here are a few of my favorite educational YouTube channels:
‚Ä¢MinutePhysics (all kinds of cool physics)
‚Ä¢CrashCourse (history, chemistry, astronomy, and much more)
‚Ä¢AsapSCIENCE (science topics ranging from biology to psychology)

For more suggestions, check out this Mashable article.

4. Watch documentaries.

You can watch thousands of high-quality documentaries for free at Documentary Heaven.

5. Get a job.

Don‚Äôt worry too much about what the job will pay. As the saying goes, ‚ÄúTake a job for what you will learn, not for what you will earn.‚Äù

This is especially true when it comes to school holiday jobs. The best learning experience might just come in the form of an unpaid job or internship.

6. Learn a new language.

Visit these websites and learn a new language:
‚Ä¢Duolingo
‚Ä¢Babbel
‚Ä¢BBC Languages

7. Find a cause you care about.

The school holidays are a good time to give back.

Find a cause you care about, and start thinking of ways to support that cause. Then read this article, which lists 10 ways to support a good cause.

8. Volunteer.

As a follow-up to Point #7, find a practical way to serve and contribute. You could volunteer to clean up the beach, help out at a nursing home or animal shelter, or deliver meals to the elderly.

9. Improve your physical health.

You have more time during the school holidays. So this is a great opportunity to start sleeping well, exercising regularly, and eating healthily.

10. Learn a new skill.

There are thousands of online courses to choose from on Coursera and Udemy.

13. Build or fix something.

Fix a broken fan, build a computer, or make a table. These are skills that will come in handy in the future.

14. Visit museums.

A trip to a museum will make you more knowledgeable, and you‚Äôll probably leave feeling inspired too.

What‚Äôs more, it‚Äôs typically free (or cheap) to get in.

‚Ä¢Juggling
‚Ä¢Gardening

‚Ä¢Dancing
‚Ä¢Photography
‚Ä¢Stargazing

18. Sell the things you aren‚Äôt using.

I‚Äôm sure you own many things you aren‚Äôt using, which other people would be willing to pay for.

So hold a garage sale, or put the items up for sale online.

19. Visit a nearby college or university.

Whenever I visit a college or university campus, I feel a sense of excitement. Colleges and universities are so full of youth, passion, knowledge, and potential.

This school holiday, visit one in your area. Learn about the courses and programs offered, and get a feel for the campus culture.

You might just leave the campus with a clearer vision of your future plans and goals.

20. Achieve an athletic goal.


Physical trainingbSave

Take Point #9 a step further and work toward a specific athletic goal.

‚Ä¢Do 60 sit-ups in 1 minute
‚Ä¢Run a mile under 7 minutes
‚Ä¢Hold a plank for 2 minutes

21. Reconnect with friends and family members.

Reconnect with friends and family members whom you didn‚Äôt get to spend much time with during the school term.

At the very least, send them a text or email to show them that you‚Äôre thinking of them.

22. Enjoy nature.

Go for a hike, have a picnic, fly a kite, or visit a nature reserve.

23. Improve your vocabulary.

Give away books and notes you no longer need, and files you no longer use. In addition, clear your desk and get organized.

This way, you‚Äôll set yourself up for a fruitful upcoming semester.

26. Develop healthy habits.


Good habitsbSave

Nathaniel Emmons once said, ‚ÄúHabit is either the best of servants or the worst of masters.‚Äù

You may even have hundreds of emails that have yet to be processed or organized.

If this describes you, then read this fantastic article by Michael Hyatt and implement his tips.

33. Talk to as many adults as possible about career options.

It‚Äôs never too early to start thinking about your future career.

Reach out to your relatives, family friends, teachers, and neighbors. Offer to buy them a cup of coffee, and ask them if they‚Äôd be willing to share their experiences and insights.

Set a goal for this school holiday of talking to at least one adult a week about career options.

34. Create a personal website.

Your chances of getting into that program you‚Äôre applying for ‚Äì or getting that job or internship ‚Äì will be higher if you have a personal website.

Your chances will be even higher if your website looks as beautiful as this one, this one, or this one.

I recommend using the WordPress platform for your website; here‚Äôs a complete website setup guide. And don‚Äôt worry, you don‚Äôt have to create your website from scratch. You can find over 30 free, professional-looking WordPress themes here.

37. Write thank-you notes.


Thank youbSave

Many people say ‚Äúthank you‚Äù via text message or email. But few people write actual thank-you notes. This school holiday, become one of those people.

Make a list of the people who have helped you in one way or another the past semester: friends, teachers, relatives, and family members.

Write each of those people a thank-you note. Then either mail the note to them or give it to them in person.

The bottom line

It‚Äôs impossible to do all 37 things described in this article. Besides, I know you also want to have plenty of fun this school holiday.

So don‚Äôt feel overwhelmed.
